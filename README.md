This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Small coding assignment for job application 

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Please note, that I haven't have done anything with React prior to this project, as I am more specialized in VanillaJS and Vue.js Applications.

Or see it directly already deployed on [Netlify](https://nits-test-bus-application.netlify.app/)
